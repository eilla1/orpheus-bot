  notAuthed: Sorry to say your Slack account isn't tied to a registered club. If you know you're a club leader this is probably just an error you can resolve by letting the staff know.
  start: >
    Hey <@${this.user}>! I'm a tool you can use to manage & get resources for your club.
  finished: >
    That's it for the tutorial!
  renameChannel:
    start: >
      Let's rename your club's channel to something more presentable (it's
      currently <#${this.channel}>). Run \`/rename-channel new-channel-name\`
      (but with a name you actually want to use).
    finished: >
      Fantastic! Your channel is your own space for your co-leaders and club members. You can rename it at anytime.
  getSticker:

      Now let's get some goodies. Hack Club has a long tradition of club stickers (hackclub.com/stickers), and we want to get some shipped to you ASAP.
      Run \`/get sticker envelope\` to get a envelope of stickers.
    finished: |
      Great! Now that you've ordered one sticker envelope you can always order another– we're happy to give more stickers to clubs in need.
      There are a couple more promos available, but some of them are only available to clubs that are actively meeting. We'll play around with that later on in the tutorial, but we'll need to record a meeting.
  meetingAdd:
    start: |
      Let's record a meeting. Normally you'd do this after each of your meetings, but to get through the tutorial we'll have you record 2 right now.
      No worries if you haven't met yet, just make something up for the tutorial– we'll cover how to remove meetings later on.

      Record a first meeting today:
        - \`/meeting-add today, 24 members\`
    progress: Great! Now add another \`/meeting-add last friday, 21 members\`
    finished: 
      Great! Now that you've got meetings recorded, your club is "active". Active clubs get access to a couple exclusive tools and services.

      You can now start a Zoom Pro meeting anywhere in the Slack by running \`/z\`.

      - The engine's running a little hot captain! Maybe ya could look into upgrading our Zoom account to increase our licenses? https://cloud-6dzm602ef.vercel.app/1392905439649605409.gif
      - Oh boy, uh, we uh, hmmmmmmmm. Our Zoom Pro account is almost out of open licenses. We're at ${this.usage} of ${this.hosts} used. Can someone bump the billing up for me?
      - "VRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM:racecar: <- that's our Zoom account racing towards our license limit. Could someone lay down some track for me?"
      - Not crazy time sensitive, but could you upgrade the Zoom licenses? <@${this.user}> just got an account & now we have ${this.hosts-this.usage} license left. https://cloud-1desdbmuy.vercel.app/bhb-gg.gif

      We can only automatically send grants once per semester, but if you think there's an error or are looking for an exception reach out to staff.
    otherSuccess: I've just reached out to staff to get your grant fulfilled. Save time by double-checking your shipping address is correct with \`/address\`.

    inactive: >
      Your club doesn't have the "active" status (run \`/stats\` to see your
      club's status and \`/meeting-add\` to record meetings). While not
      required for grants, having "active" status will go a long way in
      getting your grant approved. If you've forgotten to add any meetings
      you can record them now before your grant is reviewed by staff.
